## Description

Simple Home is a fictional furniture store that sells products through its website. Some of the products include dining tables, wardrobes, kitchen cabinets, sofas, beds, etc. On this website, users can browse all available items and add or remove them from their carts. They can also save favorite items to their wish list. Additionally, users have the option to create an account or sign in to an existing one. Furthermore, users can leave reviews if desired.

Simple Home is a dynamic web application featuring a Home page, Shop page, Contact Page, FAQ page, and Login Page. The website is built using React and utilizes the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) library for application state management and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template. React Router is employed to transform it into a single-page website.

This website is an evolution of a previous JavaScript project, now converted into a React version. It serves as a portfolio project for the React course at Nucamp Web and Mobile App Development.

# Getting Started with Create React App and Redux

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app), using the [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) and [Redux Toolkit](https://redux-toolkit.js.org/) template.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
